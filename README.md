# How to close/open the app during a session in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-behave-openApp) using the Appium Python Behave Framework

While performing automation testing with Appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where you'd want to close the application or open the application during a test run. 
This can be essential sometimes to see how your application behaves in different scenarios. Let's see how we can leverage Appium's commands to achieve it on LambdaTest.

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.
- Alternatively you can also use the `Custom ID` that you defined in your own words.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Python test on LambdaTest.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```
import sys
import os
path = os.getcwd()
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(path, os.pardir)))
from time import time
from behave import given
from appium import webdriver
import appConfig as appConf
from appium.webdriver.common.mobileby import MobileBy
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

@given("Start the android app automation test")
def startAndroidAppAutomationTest(self):
    if os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME") is None:
        username = "username" #Enter LT username here if environment variables have not been added
    else:
        username = os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME")
    if os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY") is None:
        accesskey = "accesskey" #Enter LT accesskey here if environment variables have not been added
    else:
        accesskey = os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY")

    driver = webdriver.Remote(
        command_executor="https://"+username+":"+accesskey+"@beta-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub",
        desired_capabilities=appConf.app_android_desired_caps
        )
    try:
        colorElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color")))
        colorElement.click()

        textElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text")))
        textElement.click()

        #Close the application being tested
        driver.close_app()

        #Open the application being tested
        driver.open_app()

        toastElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast")))
        toastElement.click()

        notification = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification")))
        notification.click()

        driver.quit()
    except:
        driver.quit()
```

* [Close App | Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/commands/device/app/close-app/)

## Executing The Tests

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

**Android:**

```bash
behave --tags @androidApp
```

**IOS:**

```bash
behave --tags @iosApp
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
